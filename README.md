# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

A machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn based on behavior and service usage data from a telecom company. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Project Objective
The goal is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn (Yes or No). Churn prediction helps businesses reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

## Dataset Info
**Source:** IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
**Rows:** ~7,000 customers  
**Target:** Churn column (Yes = churned, No = not churned)  
**Features:** Gender, Contract type, Monthly charges, Tenure, etc.

## Results
Achieved a high AUC-ROC score showing good distinction between churned and retained customers.  
Feature importance highlighted key factors like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
